Original prompt: clone https://github.com/neojeffersonian/bedrock

and push up like 8 separate PRs to make a minecraft themed game around reaching bedrock

## Notes
- Repository cloned from origin but is empty, so a base `main` commit is required before creating PRs.
- Plan: create 8 stacked PRs (`codex/pr1-*` through `codex/pr8-*`) to progressively build the game.
